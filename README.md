# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python
to compile a responsive and reliable dataset from the three API with which I would be able to perform an accurate regression model that will show if my relationship hypothesis is correct.
## Project/Goals
to compile a responsive and reliable dataset from the three API with which I would be able to perform an accurate regression model that will show if my relationship hypothesis is correct.

## Process
### api request
### parsing /extracting
### loading as csvs and merging 
### upload to sqlite
### find problem and and hypothesis that will give insight to problem ie.problem = want to increase bike usage  therefore hypothesis will determine if relatshionship b/w independant variables an avialalbe bikes ( want to find what lowers avialability = more users
### interpret regression results
### idea for classification model


## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)
quality and quantity were not sufficient to train a robust regression model . APi request limits diminshed the completeness of the datasets

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
the API limit !
shortage of time!


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
find more data and perform more diagnostic tests (e/t is detailed in my attached powerpoint https://lighthouselabss-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/yaelflax_lighthouselabss_onmicrosoft_com/EdFCbhbsdVpLtAteEkiFsYcBeiEetc-PIGTmUYpGJRnxsw?e=9JpcN5
