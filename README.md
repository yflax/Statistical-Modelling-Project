# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python
to compile a responsive and reliable dataset from the three API with which I would be able to perform an accurate regression model that will show if my relationship hypothesis is correct.
## Project/Goals
to compile a responsive and reliable dataset from the three API with which I would be able to perform an accurate regression model that will show if my relationship hypothesis is correct.

##Process:
1) Api request
2)parsing /extracting
3)loading as csvs and merging 
4)upload to sqlite
5)find problem and and hypothesis that will give insight to problem ie.problem = want to increase bike 6)usage  therefore hypothesis will determine if relatshionship b/w independant variables an available    bikes ( want to find what lowers avialability = more users
7)interpret regression results
8)idea for classification model


## Results

quality and quantity were not sufficient to train a robust regression model . APi request limits diminshed the completeness of the datasets

## Challenges 

the API limit !
shortage of time!


## Future Goals

find more data and perform more diagnostic tests (e/t is detailed in my attached powerpoint https://lighthouselabss-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/yaelflax_lighthouselabss_onmicrosoft_com/EdFCbhbsdVpLtAteEkiFsYcBeiEetc-PIGTmUYpGJRnxsw?e=9JpcN5
